# How I Work Best

I do my best work when I have clear requirements, well-defined tasks, and enough uninterrupted time to focus on one thing at a time. I enjoy structured workflows and appreciate visibility into priorities.

I struggle when instructions are unclear, when too many tasks are open at once, or when priorities shift without context.

# Communication Style

I prefer messages to be short, clear, and direct. Async text communication works best for me, especially when I need time to review or think before responding.

The best way to reach me is through is email but I usually check on the team’s main communication platform (Discord/Slack/GitHub) once a day to stay connected and updated. 

If you need something urgent, please send me a direct message/ email so I can respond quickly.

# Collaboration & Teamwork

I work best in a team when expectations are clear and everyone communicates respectfully and consistently.

My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is unclear instructions or last-minute changes without explanation.

If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am processing the information or thinking through the details before responding.

# Focus & Productivity

I stay focused by working in quiet stretches, using structured to-do lists, and completing tasks one at a time. Movement breaks and short pauses help me reset and stay productive.

Things that distract me include unclear tasks, frequent interruptions, and rapid context switching.

The best way to support my productivity is by giving me clear goals, well-scoped tasks, and enough space to do focused work.

# Feedback & Growth

I like feedback to be clear, constructive, and actionable. I prefer private feedback for improvements and group sharing for wins or positive reinforcement.

When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to explain the issue directly and help me understand how to correct it. I value learning, so I appreciate feedback that guides improvement.

I appreciate it when teammates communicate openly, share context, and support each other.

# Fun Facts & Quirks

One thing people often misunderstand about me is that if I’m quiet, I am not disengaged, I’m just thinking or processing.

A fun fact about me: I enjoy exploring new tools, learning through hands-on tasks, and improving how I work.

My work superpower is attention to detail and the ability to learn quickly when given clear direction.
