1. When do you prefer using AI vs. Google?

I prefer using AI (ChatGPT) when I want:

- Explanations in simple, clear language
- Examples of how a concept works
- Debugging help where I need step-by-step guidance
- To understand multiple approaches to a problem
- Help reasoning through React, Redux, or async logic

I prefer using Google when:

- I need official documentation (e.g., MDN, React docs)
- I'm dealing with an error message many developers have already solved
- I want quick code snippets from StackOverflow
- The problem is simple and widely known

AI is great for learning and reasoning.
Google is great for verified, official sources.


2. How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when:

- The issue is project-specific (architecture, folder structure, naming conventions)
- The problem is blocking my progress
- There is a deadline, and spending hours debugging isn’t efficient
- The code involves sensitive information
- I need clarification about how a feature is expected to work, not how to code it

Colleagues provide context + expectations, which AI and Google cannot.

3. What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

Developers often struggle with:

- Not knowing what keywords to search for
- Overthinking simple problems
- Getting stuck on something that an experienced teammate could fix in 2 minutes
- Conflicting information online
- Not being sure if a solution applies to their project
- Spending too much time debugging instead of progressing

This is why developing a strategy (Google → AI → colleague) helps keep the workflow efficient.
