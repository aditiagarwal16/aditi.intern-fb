Reflection
When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

AI is most useful when I need help drafting content, generating ideas, summarising information, or speeding up repetitive tasks. It can also help with troubleshooting and understanding unfamiliar concepts. However, I should rely on my own skills when making decisions, writing final versions of work, evaluating accuracy, or handling tasks that require judgment, creativity, or confidentiality. AI should support my work, not replace my thinking.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

I can avoid over-reliance by treating AI outputs as suggestions rather than finished answers. Reviewing, editing, and validating everything generated ensures that I stay actively engaged in the work. I should continue practicing my own skills, double-checking facts, and using AI only when it adds value. Maintaining a balance helps me grow as a developer while still improving efficiency.

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

I will avoid entering any confidential data, user information, internal documents, or private code into AI tools. I will only use AI with information that is safe to share publicly. Before submitting anything, I will check whether it contains sensitive details. I will also review company policies to ensure I am following approved guidelines for safe and responsible AI use.
