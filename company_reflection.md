# Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Focus Bear was created to support people with ADHD and autism by offering a productivity and wellbeing app that actually understands their needs. The team behind Focus Bear includes neurodivergent individuals, which helps ensure the app is designed from lived experience rather than assumptions. The app focuses on everyday challenges such as staying focused, forming consistent routines, and managing time and punctuality, which are common struggles within the community. By addressing these issues in a practical and supportive way, Focus Bear aims to make daily life feel more manageable rather than overwhelming.

# What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear is solving the problem of poor focus and productivity, especially for people who feel overwhelmed by tasks or easily distracted. It helps users break tasks into manageable steps and build routines that make daily work easier. Focus Bear also helps neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD and autism, manage productivity challenges by addressing issues like distraction, inconsistent routines, and time blindness.

# Why do you think this mission is important?

I think this mission is important because many productivity tools are designed for neurotypical users and often don’t work well for people with ADHD or autism. When these tools fail, it can make neurodivergent individuals feel lazy or unmotivated, even though the real issue is a lack of appropriate support. Focus Bear’s mission recognises that productivity looks different for everyone and that neurodivergent people need tools that work with their brains rather than against them. By addressing challenges like distraction, time blindness, and difficulty building routines, the app helps reduce stress and self-blame while supporting healthier work habits. This makes productivity more accessible and inclusive, which can have a positive impact on mental health, confidence, and overall wellbeing.

# How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear’s work aligns with my values because I strongly believe in designing technology that is inclusive and genuinely helps people rather than pressuring them to fit a one-size-fits-all standard. As a student, I understand how overwhelming productivity expectations can be, especially when balancing deadlines, focus, and wellbeing at the same time. Focus Bear’s approach of supporting mental health alongside productivity resonates with my interest in user-centred design and ethical technology. Instead of promoting hustle culture, the app encourages healthy routines, self-awareness, and realistic goal-setting, which reflects my belief that success should be sustainable and not come at the cost of wellbeing.


# Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I personally relate to several of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve. As a student, I sometimes struggle with staying focused for long periods, managing my time effectively, and maintaining consistent routines, especially during busy or stressful weeks. Distractions from my phone or laptop can make it harder to start tasks or stay on track once I do. Tools like Focus Bear feel relatable because they acknowledge these challenges without being judgmental and provide practical support rather than unrealistic expectations. This makes productivity feel more achievable and less overwhelming.
