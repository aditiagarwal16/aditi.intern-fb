Reflection — i18next Setup

1. Challenges I faced while setting up i18next

The main challenge was handling dependency conflicts because recent versions of i18next require TypeScript 5, while my React project uses TypeScript 4. Once I installed a compatible version of i18next, the setup worked smoothly. Another challenge was understanding how the translation resources and language switching hooks (useTranslation) worked together.

2. Why is i18next better than manually handling translations?

i18next handles everything automatically—storing translations, switching languages, formatting text, and managing fallback languages. Without i18next, I would have to manually write logic to load translation files, store selected languages, and update UI components, which would be error-prone and hard to maintain.

3. How would I handle dynamic content in a multilingual app?

For user-generated or dynamic content, I would wrap text inside translation keys or format values using i18next interpolation. If content comes from an API, I would ensure the backend provides localized versions or apply translation mapping on the client side.
