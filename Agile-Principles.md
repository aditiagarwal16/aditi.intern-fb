Reflection
What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

One of the biggest benefits of Agile is its flexibility. Agile allows teams to adapt quickly when priorities change and helps maintain steady progress through small, incremental improvements. It also improves communication because team members share updates regularly and collaborate closely. Another benefit is transparency, since the workflow and priorities are visible to everyone.

The main challenges of Agile include keeping tasks properly updated and maintaining consistent communication across the team. Agile requires discipline to keep the board organized and to avoid taking on too much work at once. In distributed teams, staying aligned can also be harder without clear written updates.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile principles can help improve my role by encouraging continuous feedback, better prioritization, and clear communication. Breaking work into smaller pieces makes it easier to deliver progress more consistently. Regular updates help the team understand what I am working on, and transparency helps avoid misunderstandings. Agile principles also encourage collaboration, which helps me work more effectively with product managers, designers, and developers.


Summary of the main differences between Scrum and Kanban

Scrum works in fixed-length cycles called sprints. Work is planned in advance, and the team commits to completing a defined set of tasks within the sprint. Scrum includes structured ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

Kanban uses a continuous flow model without sprints. Tasks move across a board based on priority and capacity, and work-in-progress is limited to avoid overload. Kanban allows changes at any time and is more flexible than Scrum. Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because priorities shift frequently, and continuous workflow suits the team better than sprint-based planning.

One Agile principle that will be most useful in my work

The principle of delivering work in small, incremental steps will be the most useful for me. Breaking tasks into smaller pieces helps me stay organised, communicate progress clearly, and avoid being blocked. It also makes it easier to adjust based on feedback and improves collaboration with the team.
