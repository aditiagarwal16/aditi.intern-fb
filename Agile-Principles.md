Reflection
What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

One of the biggest benefits of Agile is its flexibility. Agile allows teams to adapt quickly when priorities change and helps maintain steady progress through small, incremental improvements. It also improves communication because team members share updates regularly and collaborate closely. Another benefit is transparency, since the workflow and priorities are visible to everyone.

The main challenges of Agile include keeping tasks properly updated and maintaining consistent communication across the team. Agile requires discipline to keep the board organized and to avoid taking on too much work at once. In distributed teams, staying aligned can also be harder without clear written updates.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile principles can help improve my role by encouraging continuous feedback, better prioritization, and clear communication. Breaking work into smaller pieces makes it easier to deliver progress more consistently. Regular updates help the team understand what I am working on, and transparency helps avoid misunderstandings. Agile principles also encourage collaboration, which helps me work more effectively with product managers, designers, and developers.
