What is the purpose of CI/CD?

CI/CD ensures that every change pushed to a repository is automatically tested, scanned, and validated. It catches bugs early, keeps code quality consistent, and allows teams to deploy updates quickly and safely.

How does automating style checks improve project quality?

Automated linting prevents common issues such as inconsistent formatting, spelling mistakes, and invalid Markdown. This ensures cleaner pull requests, reduces manual review effort, and enforces team-wide standards.

What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?

CI/CD checks may block merges if misconfigured, and they can slow down development if workflows take long to run. Developers must adapt their workflow to fix issues flagged by automated tools, which may require learning new tools.

How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?

Small projects use simple workflows (linting, testing), while large teams use complex pipelines including test suites, security scans, performance analysis, and multi-stage deployments. Larger teams need stricter workflows and faster build systems to support many contributors.
