Reflection
How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can adjust my communication style by keeping messages clear, simple, and structured. Breaking information into smaller steps and avoiding long or ambiguous instructions helps reduce confusion and cognitive load. I can also give people more time to process information before expecting a response and use a calm, supportive tone. When communicating with teammates, I can check in to make sure my message makes sense and ask whether they prefer written or verbal communication.

What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Common pitfalls include cluttered interfaces, unnecessary animations, inconsistent navigation, vague labels, and sudden changes without explanation. Long paragraphs, unclear instructions, or notifications that are too frequent can overwhelm users with ADHD or Autism. UX patterns that require multitasking or rapid decision-making can also create friction. In communication, sending long blocks of text, using indirect language, or assuming prior knowledge can make interactions less inclusive.

What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make is to focus on clarity and predictability when working on UI elements. This means keeping layouts simple, avoiding unnecessary visual noise, and making sure each interaction has a clear purpose. I can also write instructions in a step-by-step format and double-check that any feature I work on reduces cognitive load instead of adding to it.
