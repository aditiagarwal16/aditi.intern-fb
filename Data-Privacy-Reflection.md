What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

I can handle data securely by following the privacy guidelines provided by Focus Bear, avoiding unnecessary access to sensitive information, and ensuring I only use data for approved work purposes. I should keep my device secure with passwords, avoid downloading sensitive files unless required, and always verify that any shared information is sent through approved and secure channels. Being mindful of what I store locally and regularly reviewing my workspace for unnecessary data also helps maintain secure practices.

How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

Sensitive information should be stored only in authorised platforms such as secured company systems or encrypted storage if needed. It should not be saved on personal devices or shared through unapproved messaging tools. When sharing confidential information, I should verify the recipient, use secure communication channels, and follow the principle of least privilege. For disposal, sensitive data should be deleted permanently from devices, cleared from local storage, and removed from any temporary workspaces so it cannot be recovered.

What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

Common mistakes include saving confidential files on personal devices, sharing information through unsecured messages, leaving laptops unlocked, reusing weak passwords, and not verifying the legitimacy of a data request. These issues can be avoided by locking screens when stepping away, using strong and unique passwords, following internal guidelines on communication, being cautious with unfamiliar links or emails, and consistently reviewing what information is being stored or shared.
