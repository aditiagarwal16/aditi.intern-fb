# Terminal Setup & Command Line Knowledge

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I use the default macOS Terminal with the zsh shell. I chose this because it is already well integrated with macOS, stable, and powerful enough for daily development tasks without requiring extra setup.

## What customizations did you make?

I did not add heavy customizations. I mainly relied on the default zsh configuration. This helped me focus on learning core command-line usage instead of spending time on visual changes. I may explore themes and aliases later as I become more comfortable.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful commands were:

- `git status` – to check the current state of the repository  
- `git branch` and `git switch` – to manage branches  
- `npm run` – to understand available project scripts  

These commands helped me understand what was happening in my project and avoid mistakes when committing or pushing code.

## Reflection

Using the terminal regularly has made me more confident working with Git, Node.js projects, and debugging issues. It gives better control over the development workflow compared to relying only on a GUI.
