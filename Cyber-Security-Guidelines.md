What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

I currently use strong passwords, avoid clicking suspicious links, and keep my devices locked when I step away. I also avoid storing sensitive information in unapproved locations and make sure software updates are installed. One area where I can improve is using a password manager consistently instead of remembering passwords or saving them manually in browsers. I can also be more proactive about checking the authenticity of emails and messages before responding.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

I can make secure behaviour a habit by automating as much as possible for example, enabling automatic updates, automatic screen locking, and 2FA on accounts. Building small routines, such as locking my screen every time I leave my desk and double-checking the sender of unexpected emails, helps make security part of my normal workflow. Treating security steps as essential rather than optional also makes them easier to follow regularly.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

I will use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and store them in a password manager instead of reusing credentials. I will enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, especially for work tools and email. I will avoid sharing passwords or storing them in unsecured locations. I will also review my password list regularly to remove outdated or weak passwords.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If I suspected a breach, I would immediately change my passwords, notify the appropriate team or supervisor, and secure my devices. I would review recent account activity and revoke access for any unknown devices or sessions. If necessary, I would disconnect from the network and follow Focus Bear’s escalation process. Acting quickly is important to prevent further damage or data exposure.
