Reflection
Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes, I have experienced great teamwork when everyone communicated clearly, respected each other’s ideas, and supported one another when someone was stuck. What made it effective was the openness to ask questions, the willingness to help, and the positive attitude people maintained even during challenging tasks. Professionalism showed through reliability, kindness, and accountability.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

I can take the time to write messages thoughtfully, avoid assumptions, and ask for clarification when something is unclear. I can use a polite and neutral tone, especially in written communication, since it can be easily misinterpreted. I can also be mindful of time zones, avoid interrupting others, and make sure my feedback or questions are phrased respectfully. Being inclusive means acknowledging different perspectives and making sure everyone feels comfortable contributing.

How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can maintain a friendly attitude, show appreciation for others’ work, and be supportive when teammates face challenges. Participating actively in discussions, sharing helpful ideas, and celebrating team wins contribute to a positive atmosphere. At the same time, being reliable with my tasks and responsibilities helps maintain professionalism.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

I can prepare by reviewing my tasks beforehand, writing down questions or topics I need clarity on, and being ready to provide updates. Having context and examples ready helps the discussion move more efficiently. I can also join meetings on time, test my setup beforehand, and listen actively during the conversation.

What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive means taking initiative such as asking for clarity early, volunteering for tasks, updating progress without needing reminders, and identifying problems before they escalate. It also involves staying engaged with the team, continuously improving my skills, and seeking feedback to grow.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information or action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response, and when would you escalate?

If I need information, I would first send a polite message summarizing what I need and why. If there is no response after a reasonable time, I can follow up gently with a reminder. If the matter becomes time-sensitive or is blocking progress, I would escalate by informing a supervisor or team lead. Escalation should only happen when the issue impacts progress or deadlines, not for minor delays.

What are some things you won’t do?

I won’t use unprofessional language, make assumptions about others’ intentions, or react emotionally in discussions. I won’t ignore messages or leave tasks uncommunicated. I also won’t engage in gossip, exclusionary behaviour, or anything that makes the workspace uncomfortable for others.
