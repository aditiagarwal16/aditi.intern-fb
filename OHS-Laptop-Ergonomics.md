What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?

I can improve my workspace by raising my laptop screen to eye level using a laptop stand and using an external keyboard and mouse. This will help reduce neck bending and keep my wrists in a more comfortable position. Adjusting my chair height to ensure my feet are flat on the floor and keeping my elbows at a 90-degree angle will also improve overall posture.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?

I can sit with my back supported, keep my shoulders relaxed, and avoid leaning forward while working. Taking short breaks every 30–60 minutes can help reduce stiffness and eye strain. Performing quick posture checks throughout the day and adjusting my screen height when needed will help maintain good ergonomics.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?

I can use movement breaks and posture reminders in Focus Bear App to prompt me to stretch or adjust my position. Setting gentle notifications on my phone or computer can also help me remember to rest my eyes, stretch my neck, and reposition myself regularly. Having these reminders makes it easier to build healthy habits during long work sessions.
