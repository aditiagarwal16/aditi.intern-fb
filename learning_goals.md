## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to gain real-world experience working in a professional development environment. I want to understand how an actual product team collaborates, builds features, and manages tasks. I’m also hoping to learn how to work with modern tools and workflows that companies use daily.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I’m excited to improve my frontend development skills, especially around React, API integrations, testing, and writing cleaner code. I also want to get better at understanding product requirements, communicating with teammates, and following Agile practices.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can contribute by being consistent, proactive, and willing to learn quickly. I enjoy working on UI-related tasks, documentation,frontend tasks and improving the overall user experience. I can also bring a helpful and positive attitude to the team.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I want to get more confident with testing, writing clean reusable code, and understanding more advanced concepts like state management and backend communication. I’m also working on improving my speed and efficiency when solving bugs or learning new tools.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success for me means growing both technically and professionally. I want to be able to complete tasks independently, contribute meaningfully to features, understand how a real engineering team operates, and feel more confident in my skills by the end of the internship. If I walk away knowing I added value and learned a lot, I’ll consider the internship successful.
