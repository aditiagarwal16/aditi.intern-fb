AI Tools for Development – Reflection
# AI Tools Tried

For this task, I experimented with GitHub Copilot in VS Code and ChatGPT as an external AI assistant for coding support. I mainly used Copilot while actively writing code and ChatGPT when I needed explanations or help debugging.

# What Worked Well

GitHub Copilot was particularly useful for speeding up development. It helped by suggesting boilerplate code, completing functions, and reducing repetitive typing, especially in JavaScript and Python files. In many cases, the suggestions were context-aware and aligned well with what I was trying to implement.

ChatGPT worked well for understanding concepts and debugging. When I encountered errors or unexpected behaviour, I could describe the issue and get a clear explanation of what might be going wrong. It was also helpful when learning new concepts, as it explained things step by step in a way that was easy to understand.

# What Didn’t Work Well

Sometimes Copilot’s suggestions were incorrect or overly generic, especially for more complex logic. It still required me to carefully review the code rather than blindly accepting suggestions. Similarly, ChatGPT occasionally provided solutions that were slightly outdated or not perfectly suited to my specific project setup, so verification was necessary.

# When AI Is Most Useful for Coding

I think AI is most useful for:

- Generating starter code or boilerplate
- Speeding up repetitive tasks
- Debugging small to medium issues
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts or errors

However, it works best as a support tool rather than a replacement for understanding the code. The developer still needs to think critically, test outputs, and make final decisions.

# Overall Reflection

Overall, using AI tools improved my efficiency and confidence while coding. When used responsibly, AI can enhance productivity and learning, especially for students, as long as it is combined with personal problem-solving and understanding.
