# What Makes a Good Commit Message?

A good commit message is:

- Clear and descriptive — it explains what changed and why it was changed.
* Specific — it focuses on one logical change.
* Short but meaningful — the title is usually under 50 characters.
* Action-oriented — starts with a verb (e.g., “Add”, “Fix”, “Update”, “Refactor”).
* Structured — optional body explaining context or reasons.

Good commit messages help maintain a clean project history and allow teams to quickly understand the evolution of the codebase.

# How Clear Commit Messages Help in Collaboration

- Clear commit messages make teamwork smoother because:
* Other developers can easily understand what was changed without reading the entire diff.
* They help during code reviews, making it easier to track specific updates.
* They act as documentation, so future team members can understand decisions taken earlier.
* They make debugging easier — developers can track down where and why a bug was introduced.

In a real-world team, clear commit messages save a lot of time and reduce confusion.

# How Poor Commit Messages Cause Issues Later

- Poor commit messages like “fix stuff”, “update”, “changes” can create major problems such as:
* Difficulty understanding what actually changed.
* Harder to revert or debug specific commits.
* Conflicts take longer to resolve because no one knows the intention behind changes.
* Slower onboarding for new developers.
* Reduced traceability when searching for when/why a bug started.

In short, unclear commit messages make the entire project harder to maintain.
