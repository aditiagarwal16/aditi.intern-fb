How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban helps manage priorities by making all tasks visible and easy to understand at a glance. On the Focus Bear board, tasks are grouped by priority levels such as Super Low Priority, Very Low Priority, Blocked, and other triage categories. This helps the team focus on the most important work first instead of trying to manage too many tasks at once. Because work is pulled based on capacity, it prevents overload and helps maintain a steady, manageable workflow.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by updating task status or priority more consistently, limiting how many tasks I start at the same time, and completing one item before beginning another. Keeping my section of the board accurate helps others understand what I am working on and reduces confusion. Using clearer descriptions and keeping tasks organized by priority can also improve my overall productivity.
