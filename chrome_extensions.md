# Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## Extensions Installed

### React Developer Tools
I installed React Developer Tools to inspect React components, props, state, and hooks directly in the browser. This makes it much easier to understand how components are structured and how state changes over time.

### Redux DevTools
Redux DevTools was installed to help debug global state. It allows me to see dispatched actions, inspect the Redux store, and time-travel through state changes, which is very helpful when tracking bugs.

### JSON Viewer
I installed a JSON Viewer extension to automatically format API responses in the browser. This makes large JSON responses easier to read and understand during debugging.

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse was installed to audit performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices for web applications. It provides clear reports and suggestions for improving app quality.

## Most Useful Things Learned

The most useful insight was learning how React Developer Tools and Redux DevTools complement each other. React DevTools helps understand UI behavior, while Redux DevTools explains how data flows through the application. Lighthouse also helped me understand how performance and accessibility can be measured early during development, not just at the end.

## Reflection

These extensions significantly improve debugging speed and confidence. Instead of guessing what the app is doing internally, I can directly inspect components, state, and network responses, which leads to faster problem resolution and better code quality.
