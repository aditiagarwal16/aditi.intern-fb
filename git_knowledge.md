Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I have used Git before, mainly for university projects and personal development work. I used Git to manage versions of code, push assignments, collaborate with teammates, and submit tasks on GitHub. I also used VS Code’s Source Control panel to commit, push, and pull changes.

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose to use Git inside VS Code because it is convenient and integrated directly into my workflow. The built-in Git panel makes it easy to view changes, stage files, and commit updates without switching applications. I also use the Git command line for certain tasks because it gives me more control and helps me understand Git more deeply.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned is how Git helps maintain a complete history of changes, allowing you to revert or review previous versions at any point. I also learned more about how branching works and how it keeps new work isolated until it is ready to be merged. Seeing how GitHub integrates with Git to support remote collaboration was also useful.
